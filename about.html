           Yes this is me, and yes this is the highest quality picture of me that I could find on the internet.
           Aside from the few things I think are core things I do, I have other hobbies that include 
           drawing, weight lifting, and baking. Although I mentioned a few things, I won't be talking about those.

            Mountain Biking <br><br>
           <img src="Images/biking.jpg" alt="bike"><br>
           Mountain biking is really fun, but also the worst experience ever, and
           the most meticulous form of torture known to man. Usually whenever I go biking I bike about 8 miles, any more and my legs refuse to work.
           Currently I don't have a bike as I sold it to get a better one next season.

            Cooking <br><br>
           <img src="Images/katsu.jpg" alt="katsu"><br>
           I like cooking, cooking in itself isn't that fun, and honestly im kinda bad at it. 
           BUT cooking also means I get to eat good food, so therefore I learned how to. 
           One of my favorites is Chicken Katsu.
