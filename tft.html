                TFT is the best video game ever created. I also happen to be very good at it, 
                during last two ranked seasons I had peaked Diamond 1. <br> <br>

                Most people really think the game is boring, which it is, but it is still the best.
                Usually in almost all my games I am the greatest of all time, but the other 90% of the time I am dog water

                I spend lots of my free time playing games, which would make sense as to why I would play many games. <br><br>

                My second favorite game of all time would be Terraria. This game is a sandbox game that also has progression and bosses. The picture show here is proof I beat 
                all bosses and soft-hundred-percented the game in it's hardest mode. <br>
                 No I haven't activated windows.

                Jason is what we call the peak male. Any person would pursue or rather GAME him. <br><br>

                Many people wouldn't understand why he is the ideal man, me too am confused. But one thing everyone can agree on is that he is not a man, 
                but rather a god in human form.
