                TFT is the best video game ever created. I also happen to be very good at it, 
                during last two ranked seasons I had peaked Diamond 1. <br> <br>

                Most people really think the game is boring, which it is, but it is still the best.
                Usually in almost all my games I am the greatest of all time, but the other 90% of the time I am dog water
